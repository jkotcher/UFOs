# UFOs


# Overview

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with the ability to filter a dataset of UFO sightings in the US.  As a first attempt to give the user some functionality with filtering the data a filter by date was used.  In an update to the web app giving the user the ability to refine their search even more was the goal.  With that goal in mind a new function in the app.js file was created and on the webpage the filters for city, state, country and shape were added.

# Results
As a first step in the original iteration of the web app the only search criteria available was to filter by date.  In addition to only being able to filter by date there was a button to click in order for the filter to be applied.  In this second iteration more user input has been added by adding four more filters to the webpage.

In the image there are five different criteria for a user to input depending on how they want to filter the data.  The key takeaway is that with this added functionality a user can refine their search to exactly what they want.  Say someone wants to search for sightings in a particular city or a specific state they are able to do that.  Say a user wanted to look for UFO sightings in only Phoenix, Arizona, they can do that.

With just this filter a user is able to get a very specific sighting and its only one sighting.  So for the user this is very good because they now have the one sighting they want without looking through the entire dataset and only having one search filter to filter by.  Now what if a user was not concerned with a specific city but wanted to look in an entire state.  With the added filters they are able to do that.

Is one able to search across multiple filters to find the sightings they want?  Yes they are able to do that as well.  In this instance a user may want to know if a particular shape of UFO sightings occurs in a given state.  Perhaps a user knows that a particular state is known for having many UFO sightings but is interested to see what sort of shapes were seen in those sightings.  In the image below maybe a user wanted to see triangle shaped sightings that occurred in California.

Now say that same user was from San Diego and was interested in seeing the triangle shaped sightings that occurred in the state of California in the city of San Diego.  The user is able to pinpoint that.

# Summary
Its great that the webpage now has added filter criteria and users don't have to only use the date as the only filter.  One drawback however of this new design is that the webpage will filter if you change anything.  Having a button to click to clear all the filters would be great so that you could start fresh with a new search.

One recommendation would be to add a clear filter button.  A second recommendation would to add the ability to filter based on the duration of the sighting.  Perhaps researchers knew they wanted to do research on the shape of an object sighted and how long it was seen for.  The webpage in its current design is not able to filter on that, much of the filters are location or date based.
